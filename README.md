# Anime Sketch Generator Based on GAN and CNN
We made a web application to generate sketch anime in the project. The website could receive the stick figure as input and then returns an anime sketch as the output. In the process of solving this problem, we explored the method to build GAN and CNN for anime generation. After our experiment, we achieved the goal to do anime generation. With more figures and better pose structure, this application will have better performance. 
 
# About CNN
In deep learning, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual images. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommending systems, image classification, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.

# About GAN
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) shows impressive results in image generation, image transfer, super-resolution and many other generation tasks. GAN model trains a generator model and a discriminator model at same time, where the discriminator tries to distinguish the real example, sampled from ground-truth images, from the samples generated by the generator. On the other hand, the generator tries to produce realistic samples that the discriminator is unable to distinguish from the ground-truth samples.
