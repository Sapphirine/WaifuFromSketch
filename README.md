# WaifuFromSketch
We made a web application to generate sketch anime in the project. The website could receive the stick figure as input and then returns an anime sketch as the output. In the process of solving this problem, we explored the method to build GAN and CNN for anime generation. After our experiment, we achieved the goal to do anime generation. With more figures and better pose structure, this application will have better performance.
